Promotion Of Active Transport
=============================

Active transport (walking and cycling) reduces congestion, pollution, 
and disease. We would support promoting active transport through 
integrated Health and Transport policy.

We believe in the health benefits to the extent that we would consider 
promotion of active transport to be a health issue; cycling promotion 
is currently fragmented, and split between Department of Transport and 
NHS budgets; we would move all such funding into the scope of a single 
NHS project. This would result in a net saving to the NHS, since 
obesity, heart disease, and other inactivity-related illnesses would be 
significantly reduced as a result.
