High Speed 2 And Northern Rail Infrastructure
=============================================

Updating the capacity and capability of our public transport 
infrastructure to meet future needs is a key goal. We would implement 
the High Speed 2 programme as currently planned. In addition we would 
work for a northern link Liverpool/Manchester/Leeds/Sheffield which 
meets communities needs in the North.
