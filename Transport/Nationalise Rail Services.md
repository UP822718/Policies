Nationalise Rail Services
=========================

Rail privatisation has made a mess of rail provision in the UK. Ticket 
prices are on the rise, and seats are in short supply. Rail is more 
highly subsidised now that it was prior to privatisation - since 1985, 
rail subsidies have increased five-fold in real terms. Profits are 
increasingly funnelled out of the country via contracts with 
international providers.  

We would renationalise the railways; we would do this gradually; as 
contracts expired, provision for each area would be renationalised.
