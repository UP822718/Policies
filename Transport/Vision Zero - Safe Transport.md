Vision Zero - Safe Transport
============================

Our safe transport goal would be zero road deaths, zero road injuries, 
and zero fear of traffic.

Transport systems are traditionally designed for maximum capacity and 
mobility, not safety. This means road users are held responsible for 
their own safety. The Vision Zero Initiative takes the opposite 
approach. We place the main burden for safety on system design because 
we recognise human weaknesses and low tolerance to mechanical force. 
Ultimately, no one should die or suffer serious injury in traffic.

A new Road Traffic Safety Bill will set an ultimate target of no deaths 
or serious injuries on the roads, and is not merely content to reduce 
accidents to an economically manageable level.
