Open Source Software In Schools
===============================

Instead of councils blanket installing Microsoft or other expensive 
proprietary software, they will be set a quota of what % of their 
software should be Open Source. The software can range from Operating 
Systems, Office Suites, E-Mail Clients or other.

The Quota would gradually increase as councils become more familiar with 
Open Source alternatives.
