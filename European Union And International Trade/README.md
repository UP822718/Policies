European Union & International Trade
==========================================

# The European Union

### Brexit

We recognise the result of the 2016 Referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.
With a 52% share of the vote to Leave, it represents a clear desire to change
our relationship with the EU. However, the Pirate Party is unable to either
proceed with the exit or reverse it alone. As such, the Pirate Party would
support any outcome that ensures and safeguards our principles, such as the
protection of human rights, civil  and digital liberties,  knowledge sharing,
accountability and transparency of government, and evidence-based policy-making.

### EU

Whilst we remain a member of the EU, and should we continue to remain a member,
we will push for the EU to uphold our principles, and to work further towards
transparency and accountability by moving law-making powers away from the
Commission and Council towards the directly-elected European Parliament, to be
more in line with the UK's own Parliamentary system. We would also call for the
EU to ensure it limits decision making to supranational issues, and correctly
devolves responsibility for national issues to their respective national
governments, only providing guidance where necessary.

We would continue to keep the UK out of the Euro. We would push to ensure the EU
doesn't make joining the Euro a membership requirement now or in the future. We
would also aim to ensure that non-Euro countries aren't prejudice in their
decisions affecting the Common Market. We will continue to withhold support for
the Euro monetary union until such a point as they can demonstrate they can use
an economic model that balances the load between members of the union to ensure
that a fiscal crisis such as the one that occurred in Greece isn't allowed to
happen again.

We will seek to minimise or abolish EU data retention laws and remove them in
the UK, to limit the amount of private information websites are required to log
about their users.

We do not support the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive 
(IPRED), an attempt by the European Union to increase  penalties and 
eventually criminalise commercial copyright and patent infractions 
within the EU. IPRED which includes confiscatory and subpoena powers to 
copyright holders in civil cases should be repealed and attempts to 
bring forward IPRED2 should be halted. SWIFT data, passenger records 
should not be permitted to leave the EU without a concrete suspicion of 
crime that is punishable within the EU state the data originated.

# International Trade

### Brexit and Trade

The Pirate Party will commit to pushing for negotiations that protect existing
industries and without compromising our principles. The Pirate Party is wary
that on leaving the European Union, we may be susceptible to being pushed into
deals like ACTA by larger trading partners such as the US, which contain
policies like *Investor-state dispute settlement* (ISDS) agreements that could
jeopardise the independence and competitiveness of public-sector services.
