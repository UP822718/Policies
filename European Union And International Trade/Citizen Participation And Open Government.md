Citizen Participation And Open Government
=========================================

### Democracy Add-On for Europe
Whilst we remain a member of the European Union, Pirate Party UK would demand 
the writing of a new European Union treaty designed to clarify and replace 
current treaties and address the need for democratic reform within the Union, 
provided it is accepted by the citizens of the Union through a referendum.

The present EU legislative process is dominated by the executive branch
(the European Commission) at the expense of the directly-elected legislative 
branch (the European Parliament). Pirate Party UK feels redressing this balance
and putting more power in the hands of the democratically-elected legislative
branch would go a long way to proving the European Union's democractic
credentials

### Removal of Unfair Barriers to Political Participation
Pirate Party UK want citizens to be able to have a more direct and larger impact
in the policy debate and decision making process, both individually and
collectively. We would therefore demand the removal of unfair barriers to the
participation of new political parties in elections, such as the requirement to 
collect a burdensome number of signatures
