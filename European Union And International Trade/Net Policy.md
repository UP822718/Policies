Net Policy
==========

The digital revolution has changed social and economic structures
throughout Europe; free and equal access to the internet is now a basic
requirement for participation in civil society.

Citizens should have the right to access the Internet anonymously.

Pirate Party UK wishes to include the right of “digital participation” in the
European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and should we withdraw from ECHR post
Article 50, we'd expect the same right to be included in a "British Bill of 
Rights"

### Net Neutrality
Pirate Party UK would seek to defend network neutrality's place in European law 
to ensure strong incentives for investment, fair competition and equal treatment
of everybody in the digital space.

Post Article 50, Pirate Party UK would insist on Parliament retaining network
neutrality laws as part of any "Great Repeal Bill"

Everyone must be able to have access to an Internet connection that does
not discriminate against any service or competitor. Traffic management
measures shall only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, operated in
a clear and transparent manner and only for technical reasons.

### Upgrading of Net Infrastructure
Pirate Party UK strongly supports the Europe-wide development of 
state-of-the-art communications infrastructure. Our goal is to provide access to
broadband for everyone in the EU. We would seek to end private monopolies over
the critical internet backbone structure making improved connectivity possible.
