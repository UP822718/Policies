Open Access And Open Data
=========================

### Open Access
The results of any research funded, in whole or in part, by public money
must be published in open access scientific journals or by other means
which make them readily accessible to the general population for free.

### Open Data
All data created for public use, regardless of origin, should be freely
available to the general public, as long as personal details are not
revealed without the consent of the concerned individuals. Such data
shall be made available in an appropriate form, which shall also include
a form for data processing. Access must not be limited by fees, licenses
or excessive application procedures or technical means.

As such, Pirate Party UK will seek to protect and expand on the Freedom of
Information laws.
