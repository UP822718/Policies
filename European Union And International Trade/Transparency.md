Transparency
============

### Disclosure of influence on political decisions
Pirate Party UK calls for the disclosure of the influence of interest groups and
lobbyists on political decisions to protect the democratic process and
to make the basis of decisions transparent.

### Whistle-blower Protection Law
Pirate Party UK advocates for general and comprehensive legislation to protect
persons who expose issues that are in the public interest, such as cases
of corruption, insider trading, or ethics or human rights violations
 (“whistle-blowers”).

### Transparency of the Public Sector
The public sector, including private entities carrying out work on
behalf of a public body, must be transparent. Pirate Party UK believes that it
is a fundamental right of citizens to inspect, without the need for any
specific justification, all contracts or financial benefits related to
the delivery of public sector or government projects and services.
