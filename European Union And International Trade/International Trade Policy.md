International Trade Policy
==========================

### Principles for Trade Agreements

Pirate Party UK stipulates that in all negotiations of the European Union on
trade agreements the following conditions must be met:

* Stronger participation by Parliament;
* comprehensive access to information and public hearings;
* respect for self determination and privacy; and
* the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises must be taken into
    account.

### Stronger participation by Parliament

Trade agreements contain political decisions that are important and difficult 
to change after they are adopted. It is therefore vitally important that the
only body with a direct democratic mandate to make long-lasting and sweeping
changes to policy take a centre stage in negotiations. Whilst we remain in the
EU, we would expect the European Parliament to take up that burden. After the
Article 50 process has concluded, we would expect that trade negotiations take
place as part of Parliament business between the Commons and Commons Select
Committees, rather than being left solely to the Department for International
Trade.

### Comprehensive access to information and public hearings

All documents concerning the negotiations of EU trade agreements should be
made available to the European Parliament, or Parliament post Article 50, as 
well as to the public. All negotiations and hearings with stakeholders should 
be conducted in public. We demand that all results of consultations, especially
submissions by stakeholders, must be published promptly and in full.

### Respect for privacy and self determination

Pirate Party UK considers the right to privacy and self-determination of the
people as self-evident. Therefore they also need to be respected and
promoted in the context of trade agreements.

Any trade deals made by the EU, or the UK post Article 50, must make sure that
no parties involved in the trade deals are able to infringe upon the privacy or
self-determination of others

### The interests of small and medium-sized enterprises must be taken into account

Pirate Party UK is concerned that many large international trade agreements are
done primarily for the benefit of large global enterprises. We would aim to
ensure that future trade agreements also meet the needs of SMEs to ensure they
aren't unfairly disadvantaged. For instance in 2014 YouGov reported that only 9% 
of people thought that TTIP (Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership) would 
benefit small business, yet the current government has continued to push forward
in negotiations.
