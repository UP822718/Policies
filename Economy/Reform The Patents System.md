Reform The Patents System
=========================

We believe that patents exist to reward the inventors of truly 
outstanding ideas, not to allow big businesses to stifle competition 
with an ever-growing tide of trivial, incomprehensible, overreaching 
patents.

We will stop the abuse of patent law by raising the bar on how 
innovative an idea has to be before it can be patented, and by 
prohibiting patents on software, business methods, concepts and works of 
nature.

We will require a working model to exist before a patent is granted and 
we will strictly enforce the current rule that patents are invalid if 
they are "obvious to someone skilled in the art".

We will allow and encourage more competition in the manufacturing of 
patented devices by introducing a system of compulsory patent licensing, 
and we will provide exemptions to patent law for non-commercial use, 
personal study and academic research.
