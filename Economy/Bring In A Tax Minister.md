Bring In A Tax Minister
=======================

The UK's tax system is overcomplicated. There is a lack of clear 
responsibility for regulatory and implementation failures, and failures 
in the administration of tax credits is often seen as an administrative 
fact of life. We will aim to make it much clearer who is responsible for 
the collection and administration of our tax system by appointing a Tax 
minister.

Our Tax minister's brief will be to simplify the tax system and to 
ensure that its administration is as efficient as possible whilst also 
putting a face on a system that is often seen as faceless, bureaucratic 
and unfair.
