Create Jobs
===========

The current approach to economic stimulus (providing large amounts of 
money to certain institutions in the hope that it will eventually lead 
to increased lending and so the expansion of businesses and the creation 
of jobs) is not effective. It gives an advantage to a specific sector of 
our economy by allowing the financial sector to shape the economy of the 
UK more broadly. The economy will only recover when people have secure 
jobs and enough money to live, spend in the economy, and invest in their 
pensions and savings. Making large numbers of people redundant in the 
hope that the private sector will simply create jobs is not the right 
course of action. We will advocate a more direct approach to economic 
recovery and creating jobs.

The UK faces a number of challenges, from a lack of social housing to 
poor transport and communications links, that could be dealt with by 
initiating infrastructure projects. The product of such infrastructure 
projects would provide a long term benefit to the UK and stimulate 
future growth. We could increase the rate of high speed broadband 
expansion, improve public transport (particularly outside London) and 
make Britain a world leader in renewable energy. This will allow us to 
reduce unemployment and provide skills to people who have lost jobs in 
other parts of the economy.
