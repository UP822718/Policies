Implement A Land Value Tax
==========================

The tax system is broken and too easily evaded. A land value tax would 
raise more from the rich without penalising the poor, whilst at the same 
time being much harder to dodge than traditional income tax. It would 
also support economic productivity, as those who rely on existing assets 
for income would be charged, whereas those who work for a living would 
not. The Pirate Party would support a land value tax.
