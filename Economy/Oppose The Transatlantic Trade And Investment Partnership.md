Oppose The Transatlantic Trade And Investment Partnership (TTIP)
================================================================

TTIP has been negotiated in secret, and even elected representatives 
have been excludedLeaked drafts indicate that TTIP will favour big 
businesses at the expense of democracy. We are opposed to the proposal 
of ISDS. We would oppose TTIP and the related Comprehensive and Economic 
Trade Agreement (CETA).
