Put The Treasury's Economic Models Online
=========================================

Hiding economic data and the basis on which predictions are made is bad 
for confidence and makes it harder anyone to challenge the decisions 
made by government. The Pirate Party will ensure that information that 
aids analysis and planning, like the Treasury's economic models, are 
available to anyone via the Internet or at request.
