Reduce The ISA Allowance To £5000
=================================

The current ISA allowance per family is higher than the median family's 
total income. Only the very wealthy are able to take advantage of the 
full allowance. A reduced allowance of £5000 would mean most earners' 
savings would still be tax free.
