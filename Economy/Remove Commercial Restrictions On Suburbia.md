Remove Commercial Restrictions On Suburbia
==========================================

It is important that local and national governments do not prevent 
people from setting up businesses or innovating. We will ensure that 
there are no unreasonable barriers preventing home-owners from making 
the best possible use of their houses and gardens for work. We believe 
it is important that, within existing limitations on noise and 
environmental harm, we remove restrictions that prevent people from 
doing business from and with their homes.
