Require Subsidy Matching
========================

Many industries that are essential to the United Kingdom (including 
rail, water, electricity generation and supply, gas supply and other 
utilities) have been privatised in recent decades, but continue to rely 
on massive government subsidy for infrastructure investment. These 
private organisations then take millions in support whilst continuing to 
provide dividends to their shareholders and massive pay and benefits to 
their senior staff.

We believe that this is unfair. Where the government spends the 
taxpayers' money to ensure the delivery of an essential service, the 
taxpayer should expect to see a return for their money before private 
investors are paid dividends. Senior management should have their wages 
capped.

In addition we will propose that any government subsidy or grant to a 
profit-making company for the delivery of services should be met 
pound-for-pound by private investment.
