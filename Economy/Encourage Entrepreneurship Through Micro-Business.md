Encourage Entrepreneurship Through Micro-Business
=================================================

We will promote micro-business as a driver for innovation and 
competition in the British economy. A micro-business is a very small 
business with a single owner and no employees, one with a turnover of 
less than £2500/year. The first £1500 of income earned from 
micro-business would be tax free, nor would the income from such an 
operation have an impact on benefits.
