Nationalise BT OpenReach
========================

BT OpenReach owns and operates most of the UK Internet infrastructure In 
theory it does not benefit BT group above other users, but the 
distinction is often dubious. BT OpenReach would become a regulated 
utility like National Grid, Transco & Network Rail. This would ensure 
investment money is not wasted.
