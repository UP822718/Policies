No More Bank Bailouts
=====================

The bailing out of British banks during and shortly after the bank 
crisis by the government may have shored up some banks, but at a huge 
cost. We don't think that banks should be allowed to profit from risky 
behaviour. We must draw a line under the 'too big to fail culture' and 
resolve that the UK taxpayer is no longer required to prop-up 
incompetent or overstretched banks. There should be no more bankers' 
bailouts.

The government should still guarantee the deposits of savers at high 
street banks via an insurance scheme, but the focus of any intervention 
must be the banks' customers, not the banks themselves or their 
shareholders. To make it less likely that retail banks become insolvent, 
we will propose limitations on their activities and introduce personal 
liability for their directors, as well as encouraging shareholders in 
promoting safe practices.
