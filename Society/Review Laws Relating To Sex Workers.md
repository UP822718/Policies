Review Laws Relating To Sex Workers
===================================

The legalisation and regulation of activities around prostitution, 
especially brothels, would protect the workers and remove a significant 
revenue stream from criminals. If properly regulated, it would enable 
regular health checks to help stop spread of STDs and ensure better 
working conditions for those involved.
