Securing The NHS For Now And The Future
=======================================

The Pirate Party will require that any legislative, administrative or 
other changes to the NHS do not have a negative impact on the NHS's 
primary principles: that it meet the needs of everyone; that it be free 
at the point of delivery; and that it be based on clinical need, not 
ability to pay.

Changes to the NHS should be based upon evidence, not ideology. Changes 
should come from within the health establishment and the NHS wherever 
possible, with evolutionary change driven by a continuous, democratic 
and open discussion within the service.

Where the government is planning privatisation or permitting private 
provision of services we will ensure that transparency be at least 
equal to the scrutiny that the public provision it replaces was subject 
to. Contracts must ensure that delivery costs are guaranteed with 
penalties for failure and contingencies to ensure continuity of care.

Health provision is something that should be available to everyone. 
Like scientific ideas and culture, it is something that should be seen 
as part of the commons because without it people's freedom to act is 
limited and pressures can be placed on individuals based on the cost or 
availability of healthcare, limiting freedom of action and potentially 
freedom of expression and association.
