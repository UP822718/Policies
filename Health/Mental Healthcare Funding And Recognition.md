Mental Healthcare Funding And Recognition
=========================================

Funding for mental health services has been cut in real terms for three
years in a row, yet mental health problems account for 23% of the total
burden of disease. Despite the existence of cost-effective treatments it
receives only 13% of NHS health expenditure.

Mental health services must be funded appropriately to deal with demand
and tackle unmet needs. To achieve this, we would rebalance the NHS
budget to ensure mental health care receives the level of investment
needed to improve outcomes.
