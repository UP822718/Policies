Homeopathy And The NHS
======================

In a 2010 House of Commons report, homeopathy was described as 
"scientifically implausible", nevertheless, there are several NHS 
homeopathic hospitals NHS funding for homeopathy (or other treatments 
not supported by clinical trials) would be permitted only where no 
non-placebo treatment is available.
