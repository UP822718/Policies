Scientific Approach To Clinical Trials
======================================

Clinical trials are investigations designed to assess the effects – 
wanted and unwanted – of healthcare interventions in people.Clinicians 
and patients need access to clinical trial results to make treatment 
decisions. Our policy would adopt the "All Trials" campaign proposals.
All tests of treatments and medications on humans would be registered 
and recorded.

The "All Trials" proposals:

* Planned clinical trials should be registered, with a summary of the 
    trial protocol, before the first participant is recruited. Past 
    trials that were not registered should now be registered 
    retrospectively. This is essential if the trial was on medicines or 
    interventions that we currently use .
* A summary of results should be publicly available where the trial was 
    registered, within one year of completion of the trial. Summary 
    results from all past trials of medicines currently in use should be 
    made publicly available on a register now.
* Summary results include information on the primary and any secondary 
    outcomes measured and statistical analysis. This is part of the 
    structured information that global registries should support.
* Trial sponsors or others who produce a full report for marketing 
    authorisation or any other purpose should make this publicly 
    available. The narrative reports of adverse events and individual 
    patient data in a full report can be redacted and available on 
    request to researchers, in the same way that reports of adverse 
    incidents currently are, with a commitment that no reasonable 
    request will be refused.
