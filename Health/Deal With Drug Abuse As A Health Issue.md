Deal With Drug Abuse As A Health Issue
======================================

The abuse of illegal and legal drugs is a health issue, and it should be 
treated as such. Abusers of drugs should be provided with care, advice 
and assistance to prevent or reduce dependency, as well as support to 
ensure that they can operate effectively within society. For these 
reasons, and because the NHS largely deals with the negative 
consequences of substance abuse, it would make sense for the NHS to take 
the lead in both research and providing advice in all areas of drug 
policy, from the medicinal use of marijuana to the impact or dangers of 
new recreational drug.

* Safe locations would be provided for heroin addicts to inject under 
    medical supervision
* People would be encouraged to hand in dangerous & contaminated drugs to 
    officials
