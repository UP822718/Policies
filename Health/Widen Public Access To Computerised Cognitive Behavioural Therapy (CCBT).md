Widen Public Access To Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CCBT)
========================================================================

A trial to make computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) freely 
accessible by anyone via the Internet should be undertaken. This 
resource is available already through the NHS, but you must be referred 
by a GP to gain access. If found to be effective it would allow anyone 
who feels they may benefit by access to do so. This may help people who 
are reluctant to go to their GP over mental health concerns get the help 
they need online for free while maintaining complete anonymity.
