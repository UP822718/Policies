Abolishing Drug Patents
=======================

We aim to abolish drug patents, which will reduce drug costs 
drastically, since all drugs would become generic. This innovation would 
save the NHS vast sums of money; part of that saving will then be used 
to subsidise drug research.

The pharmaceutical industry currently spends around 15% of its patent 
drug income on research; we would support that expenditure with 
subsidies made possible in savings from the NHS. This will increase 
research budgets, while still saving the NHS money.

This policy of making all drugs generic will create a massive 
opportunity for industry to make profits, employ more people and save 
lives by encouraging the manufacture of newly generic drugs in this 
country for sale to the third world.
