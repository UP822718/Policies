Bring Appropriate Support Services Back Into The NHS
====================================================

The general public broadly trusts the NHS to deliver services. We all 
trust the NHS with our lives. In return for that trust, the NHS should 
ensure that it is using the funds apportioned to it as effectively as 
possible, even when an effective service isn't the cheapest option.

All the skills to deliver healthcare from start to finish, from cleaning 
to surgery and from transport to transplants, should be available within 
the NHS.
