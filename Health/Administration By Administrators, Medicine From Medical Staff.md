Administration By Administrators, Medicine From Medical Staff
=============================================================

Given the complexity of running a hospital and the amount of time 
involved in administration, administrative staff, must be seen as 
important to ensuring that doctors, nurses and other medical staff can 
focus on patient care, rather than being seen as a burden. Although NHS 
resources and spending must be scrutinised and transparent, it is 
important not to harm services by removing administrative staff and 
shifting the administrative burden to front-line staff.
