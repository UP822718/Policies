protection and freedoms of pregnancy
=============================================
will protect the right to abortion as it stated under  Abortion Act 1967 of  England and Wales and Scotland.

the pirate party will change the law to repeal the following from the Abortion Act 1967.

* there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.


this is done to stop the possibility of a future of genetic based eugenics. especially in cases of prenatal test to see if they have Autism, dyspraxia,  dyslexia, Aspergers or other disabilities. it should be noted some of these disabilities are commonly used in large businesses today especially tech businesses. the exception to this ware the quality of life it would be deemed to be reduce lifespan or/and cause significant suffering.

if a such prenatal test is taken then abortion should be made illegal after that point. regardless if the test comes out positive or negative.

the pirate party will want to add additional funding to families with physical or mental abnormalities to make sure that families are able to have the support needed to look after and get. additionally where funding is needed in childcare and care home by children home should be made available.
