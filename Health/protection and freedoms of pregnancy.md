=============================================
will extended the right to abortion as it stated under  Abortion Act 1967 of  England and Wales and Scotland.

this includes the following clauses of the Act.

* all Abortion will have to be signed off by all genetic parents in all cases. this include foetus with three biological parents. the exceptions are

  * if I biological parent is unknown and there is no suspected biological parent that is willing to do a test and matches then the mothers sole signature should be enough

  * If someone has power of attorney they can sign for them

  * pregnancy through rape

  * the abortion of the pregnancy of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family;

* the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman;

* continuing the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman (greater than if the pregnancy were terminated);

the pirate party will change the law to repeal the following from the Abortion Act 1967.

* there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.


this is done to stop the possibility of a future of genetic based eugenics. especially in cases of prenatal test to see if they have Autism, dyspraxia,  dyslexia, Aspergers or other disabilities. it should be noted some of these disabilities are commonly used in large businesses today especially tech businesses. the exception to this ware the quality of life it would be deemed to be reduce lifespan or/and cause significant suffering.

if a such prenatal test is taken then abortion should be made illegal after that point. regardless if the test comes out positive or negative.

the pirate party will want to add additional funding to families with physical or mental abnormalities to make sure that families are able to have the support needed to look after and get. additionally where funding is needed in childcare and care home by children home should be made available.
