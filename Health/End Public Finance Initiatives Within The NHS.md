End Public Finance Initiatives Within The NHS
=============================================

Since 1997, NHS infrastructure worth £11bn has been built under PFIs at 
a cost of £80bn. Often, PFI schemes have locked the NHS into using a 
particular company's services. No more PFI deals would be signed, and 
urgent intervention would be made where inflated PFI costs are having a 
negative impact on NHS services.
