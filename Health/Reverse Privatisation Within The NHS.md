Reverse Privatisation Within The NHS
====================================

Ongoing privatisation of NHS services is increasing inefficiencies and 
costs. We would adopt the proposals in the NHS Reinstatement Bill. This 
would ensure the NHS is publicly funded, publicly provided and publicly 
accountable.

* Reinstate the government's duty to provide the key NHS services 
    throughout England, including hospitals, medical and nursing 
    services, primary care, mental health and community services
* Declare the NHS to be a “non-economic service of general interest” 
    and “a service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority” 
    so asserting the full competence of Parliament and the devolved 
    bodies to legislate for the NHS without being trumped by EU 
    competition law and the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement 
    on Trade in Services
* Abolish the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS England) and re-establish it 
    as a Special Health Authority with regional committees,plan and 
    provide services without contracts through Health Boards, which 
    could cover more than one local authority area if there was local 
    support
* Allow local authorities to lead a 'bottom up' process with the 
    assistance of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), NHS trusts, NHS 
    foundation trusts and NHS England to transfer functions to Health 
    Boards,abolish NHS trusts, NHS foundation trusts and CCGs after the 
    transfer by 1st January 2018
* Abolish Monitor – the regulator of NHS foundation trusts, commercial 
    companies and voluntary organisations – and repeal the competition 
    and core magnetisation provisions of the 2012 Act,
* Integrate public health services, and the duty to reduce inequalities, 
    into the NHS
* Re-establish Community Health Councils to represent the interest of 
    the public in the NHS,stop licence conditions taking effect which 
    have been imposed by Monitor on NHS foundation trusts and that will 
    have the effect of reducing by April 2016 the number of services 
    that they currently have to provide
* Require national terms and conditions under the NHS Staff Council and 
    Agenda for Change system for relevant NHS staff
* Abolish the legal provisions passed in 2014 requiring certain 
    immigrants to pay for NHS services
