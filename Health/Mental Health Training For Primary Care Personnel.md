Mental Health Training For Primary Care Personnel
=================================================

Mental healthcare issues are often not recognised or properly addressed. 
We would ensure that primary care staff (GPs, Nurses, Crisis team, etc) 
are appropriately trained to deal with the mental health needs of their 
patients.This would ensure that mental health issues are promptly 
spotted and dealt with correctly.
