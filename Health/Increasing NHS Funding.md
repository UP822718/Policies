Increasing NHS Funding
======================

Since 2010 NHS funding per person has dropped in real terms. Â£800
million over the 2010-2015 government has been removed through Conservative 
budget cuts. This privatisation continued through the 2015-2017 Conservative 
government. This must be reversed if we want a health service that is fit for 
purpose. We want to increase NHS funding by 4% in real terms and bring UK 
healthcare spending in line with the G7 average. NHS funding must then continue 
to keep up with need, rising with in line with UK population growth. The NHS is 
a vital service, it is right that it be funded by general taxation. 
Privatisation needs to be undone so that we can be proud of the NHS that we all
use.
