No To Police Commissioners
==========================

The election of Police Commissioners will be a step backward for justice 
in Britain. Whilst we support the idea that those individuals entrusted 
with upholding and enforcing the law should be open to public scrutiny, 
we do not believe that they should be elected to their offices and 
subject to political pressure. The Pirate Party will abolish Police 
Commissioners.
