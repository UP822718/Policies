Day Fines
=========

In a Day-Fine system, punishments are assessed based on annual income 
after a basic subsistence level is taken into account. This would act 
closer to an equal deterrent to citizens regardless of socioeconomic 
status. Commercial fines would be scale fairly for both large 
multinational and small businesses.
