Reverse Legal Aid Cuts
======================

Justice should be equal for all in the UK, and that includes access to 
justice, regardless of income or background. The Legal Aid, Sentencing 
and Punishment of Offenders Bill will cut millions from the Legal Aid 
budget leaving victims out in the cold. The Pirate Party will reverse 
cuts to legal aid brought in by the LASPO bill, affecting domestic 
violence, immigration, employment, debt, welfare benefit, divorce, and 
welfare benefits.

Access to justice is vital if justice is to be done. Legal aid allows 
everyone to obtain adequate representation, even if they are 
impoverished. We would reverse cuts to legal aid and introduce reforms 
to ensure access. Sanctions would discourage vexatious or frivolous 
motions or pleadings.
