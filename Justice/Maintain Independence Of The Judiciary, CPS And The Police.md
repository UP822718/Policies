Maintain Independence Of The Judiciary, CPS And The Police
==========================================================

Politicians should pass laws that they feel appropriate, but it should 
be the role of the police and judges to act independently, neither 
aiming to influence nor being swayed by political or popular pressures. 
The limiting of the independence of judges, and the curtailment of their 
ability to make the right judgement and to pass appropriate sentences on 
cases that come before them can and does constitute an injustice. The 
police should act on the basis of priorities that are right for the 
areas in which they are operating. They should not be pushed to 
prioritise their resources or change the way they police on the basis of 
political demands.
