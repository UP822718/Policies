Improve The Rehabilitation Of Offenders
=======================================

We will introduce significant reforms to the Rehabilitation of Offenders 
Act 1974. The current recidivism rate in the UK is around 50%, in part 
due to discrimination against former prisoners after release. The Pirate 
Party will propose removing the requirement to declare spent criminal 
convictions and toughen legislation making it illegal to discriminate 
against people with spent convictions.
