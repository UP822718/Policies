Ensure The Police Are Effective
===============================

The number of police officers should reflect the needs of the area in 
which they operate. However, every police force should have the 
resources to ensure that police officers are both highly visible and 
available when they are needed. The numbers and balance of Police 
Community Support Officers and Police Officers in every force area 
should be sufficient to achieve that goal.
