Make Extradition Fair
=====================

No extradition should be permitted where a British Judges deems that an 
extradition would not be in the interests of justice. We will ensure 
that British judges have the power to halt an extradition until they 
were satisfied that a case is trial-ready, as well as the power to 
refuse extradition where the country seeking extradition is clearly not 
the appropriate place for trial.

We would also seek clearer rules to deal with cases where there is a 
multinational aspect to ensure cases are handled transparently and 
fairly.

We would address the perceived imbalance in the US-UK extradition treaty 
by requiring that the standards for extradition being granted and the 
information required to assess each case are the same whether an 
extradition request comes from the US or the UK. Any extradition treaty 
must not only be fair, but be seen to be fair.
