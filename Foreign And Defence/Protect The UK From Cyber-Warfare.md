Protect The UK From Cyber-Warfare
=================================

The UK's computing infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, both by hostile states and non-state actors such as
terrorist groups. We would argue that the threat is both large and
increasing, and hard to counter.

To ensure that the UK is as ready to deal with any concerted attacks on
its infrastructure and information systems it is critical that there is
funding for research into the threats we face and how to counter them.

We support the development of an offensive cyber-warfare capability to
ensure that we are capable of operating effectively in the event of a
conflict.

Given the grave threat that the abuse or misuse of an offensive
cyber-warfare capability, including our own, might pose to the UK, we
will ensure that there is full transparency of the principles employed
in both offensive and defensive cyber-warfare capabilities and spending.
We will ensure that there is legislation to prevent the use of military
cyber-warfare related equipment or techniques by the government within
the UK or against British nationals overseas.
