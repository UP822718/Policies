NATO Defence Spending Commitment
================================

A condition of NATO membership is to spend 2% of GDP on defence. The UK
would continue to observe this commitment. We firmly believe that our
Armed Forces must be well equipped with the appropriate equipment for
the tasks we ask them to undertake, and trained for the roles in which
they find themselves. 
We must ensure that we take care of the Armed Forces to the best of our
ability and use them only when absolutely necessary.
