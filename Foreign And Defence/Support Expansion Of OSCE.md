Support Expansion Of OSCE
=========================

We see cooperation as the way forward in forward in international
relations. With 57 States from Europe, Central Asia and North America,
the OSCE is the world's largest regional security organisation. We would
support the expansion of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation
in Europe (OSCE) as a way to turn international relations away from
confrontation.

The OSCE has a comprehensive approach to security that encompasses
politico-military, economic and environmental, and  human aspects. It
therefore addresses a wide range of security-related concerns, including
arms control, confidence- and security-building measures, human rights,
national minorities, democratisation, policing strategies,
counter-terrorism and economic and environmental activities. All 57
participating States enjoy equal status, and decisions are taken by
consensus on a politically, but not legally binding basis.
