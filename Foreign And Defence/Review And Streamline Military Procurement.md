Review And Streamline Military Procurement
==========================================

We will refocus defence procurement on the UK or joint UK-allied
projects. It is vitally important that costs are kept down and that
delivery of weapons systems, vehicles, communications systems and other
military procurement is both timely and that the delivered product is
appropriate to the defined need. We will ensure that our troops have
what they need when they need it.
