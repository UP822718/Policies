Allow The Use Of Commons Video Footage For Satire

We would seek to remove restrictions from broadcasters on satirising 
footage of Parliamentary proceedings. Comedy can bring politics to a 
wider audience and we believe that MPs' and peers' actions in such an 
official forum should not be immune from humorous criticism.
