Digitise Library And Museum Content
===================================

We will encourage and support libraries, museums and other organisations 
that hold collections of artefacts or materials to digitise their 
content and make it available online, in open formats, wherever 
possible. This will both preserve access to culturally important 
artefacts and increase accessibility. We would prioritise the 
digitisation of especially rare items.
