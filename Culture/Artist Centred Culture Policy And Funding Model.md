Artist Centred Culture Policy And Funding Model
===============================================

Artists should be the focus of culture sector funding, this is where the 
research and development of the creative industries happens. Success in 
increasing and protecting money going to artists, rather than 
administration or overheads, must be one of the key performance 
indicators of National Portfolio Organisations.
