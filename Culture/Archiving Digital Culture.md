Archiving Digital Culture
=========================

Digital culture is an important part of the cultural world now. Yet the 
survival of that wealth of stored material is in doubt, if an effort 
isn't made to either help fund efforts at archiving. Copyright law and 
legally unbreakable DRM hampers ability to preserve digital culture. We 
would support archival activities, including efforts to access and 
review digital content to ensure they survive for the long term. Wider 
copyright exceptions would be added for archiving and accessing archived 
content.
