The Rules of Coverage
========================
broadcasters in the UK have to agree to a licence to broadcast was occurring in Parliament.this licence is overly restricted in what they can do with these recordings and what sorts of programs they can be put on. this in turn  quashes debate and discussion amongst the people.
we would remove the following clause from the licence

* no extracts of Parliamentary proceedings may be used in any light entertainment
programme or in a programme of political satire;

* subject to paragraph (a) above, extracts of Parliamentary proceedings may be included in
broadcast ‘magazine’ programmes which also contain music or humorous features, provided
that the different types of item are kept separate;
