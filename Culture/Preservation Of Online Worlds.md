Preservation Of Online Worlds
=============================

Online worlds (games or services) often rely on a company continuing to 
run servers, these are also part of digital culture. When shutting down 
service provision, operators would be required to provide source code.
Copyright/patent exemptions would enable ongoing, non-commercial support 
for abandoned online worlds.
