Abolish Anti-Circumvention Restrictions And Laws
================================================

Under current copyright law it is unlawful to do various activities aimed at 
circumventing effective technological measures that restrict access to 
copyrighted material, even if doing so is required for lawful use. This 
includes both civil liabilities and criminal offences. In the event that 
such a “technological measure” prevents permitted acts (i.e. what could 
be lawfully done anyway), the only current remedy is to apply to the 
Secretary of State for a permit.

The Pirate Party seeks to abolish these laws, making it legal both to 
circumvent “effective technological measures” and produce, distribute 
and possess tools to aid in doing so. This would not change existing 
copyright, law, merely remove the extra layer of illegality.
