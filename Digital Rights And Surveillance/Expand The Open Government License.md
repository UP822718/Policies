Expand The Open Government License
==================================

The Open Government Licence will be expanded to all government funded 
data and material. All maps, statistics and other data that have been 
created or collated by the government will be released in open formats, 
giving the public access to research for which they have already paid. 
An exception will be made for cases that have national security or 
privacy concerns.
