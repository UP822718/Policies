Oppose The Snoopers' Charter
============================

We are fundamentally opposed to the further laws pushing for mass or 
blanket surveillance. We would oppose any reintroduction of the 
Communications Data Bill, (AKA the Snoopers' Charter) or similar 
legislation. We would similarly oppose attempts to attach similar 
legislation to other bills.
