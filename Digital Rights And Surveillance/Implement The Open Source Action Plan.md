Implement The Open Source Action Plan
=====================================

The government's existing but widely ignored Open Source Action Plan 
will be properly implemented across government, and will be promoted to 
the public and private sectors. The Action Plan encourages the use of 
free and open source software, saving money where practical and 
economically viable.
