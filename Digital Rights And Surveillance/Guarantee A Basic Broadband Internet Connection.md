Guarantee A Basic Broadband Internet Connection
===============================================

Everyone should have equal right to access the benefits that technology 
can bring. We will extend the requirement to provide basic telephone 
services to a requirement to provide a minimum level of broadband 
service, and extend this responsibility to all providers who operate in 
the UK.

Additionally, the price must be affordable, as there is no point in 
guaranteeing a service that not everyone can afford.

We know that the UK's future success depends on a modern broadband 
infrastructure supporting a free and open Internet, but to make the most 
of it we must aim to end the "Digital Divide" and ensure that everyone 
benefits from being part of a connected information society.
