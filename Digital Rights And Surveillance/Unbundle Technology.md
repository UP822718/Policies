Unbundle Technology
===================

The bundling of services with hardware has created artificial barriers 
to entry in a number of markets over the past decade. To ensure that 
innovation is possible, and to improve competition, we would aim to 
introduce a requirement that the providers of bundled services, software 
and hardware products price and offer each component individually as 
well as in a bundle. We will treat the locking of electronic devices, 
whether the locking of software to hardware or hardware to a service, as 
an anti-competitive act.
