Achieve Significant Copyright Reform
====================================

A fair and balanced copyright regime that is suitable for the 21st 
century is an absolute necessity for the UK to remain competitive in a 
global economy that is built upon ideas and innovation. Copyright should 
give artists and innovators the chance to make money from their work; 
however, that needs to be balanced with the rights of society as a 
whole.

We will reduce the duration of copyright to 10 years, closer to the 
original duration of 14 years, reflecting the much greater ease with 
which works can now be made and distributed.

Shorter copyright will encourage artists to keep on creating new work; 
will allow new art forms, such as mash-ups; and will stop big businesses 
from relying on large back-catalogues rather than investing in new 
content.

Our 10 year copyright length will include within it a renewal after 5 
years, allowing works in which the creator is no longer interested to 
fall into the public domain after 5 years.
