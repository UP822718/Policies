Limit Digital Rights Management
===============================

There is an urgent need to raise public awareness about Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) technology. We believe the public needs to be protected 
from products that can be remotely turned off by the manufacturer, 
products that 'phone home' and would therefore stop working if the 
manufacturer went bankrupt, or products that are 'region coded'. We will 
require that any product sold in the UK that includes a DRM mechanism is 
stored in without DRM in escrow against a time where access to DRM 
versions is no longer possible.
