Eliminate School Rankings By GCSE Or SAT Results
================================================

Schools must aim to educate, not to simply pass exams. The number of 
examinations that young people sit should be reduced, and schools should 
be judged on a broad range of indicators. Moreover, the examinations 
that young people sit should be appropriate to their aims and future 
development. Schools should not push students toward particular subjects 
or qualifications for any reason other than the students' wishes and 
abilities. The public ranking of schools by GCSE or SAT results should 
be discontinued.
