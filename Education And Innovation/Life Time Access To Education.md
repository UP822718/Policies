Life Time Access To Education
=============================

The best time to learn is in the earliest years, but for many people 
life events can mean that they miss out on education, or due to personal 
issues they may be incapable of taking full advantage of the education 
available to them up to the age of 18. We are committed to providing 
easy access to both basic education and higher education for all; we 
believe that the UK can build on the excellent foundations already laid 
by the Open University. University tuition fees should be frozen and 
eventually scrapped.

Tuition fees have a disproportionately negative effect on students from 
poorer backgrounds, and act as a barrier to intelligent and willing 
young people's development to their full academic potential. We believe 
that a freeze in tuition fees is necessary until a workable grant based, 
free, or means tested alternative funding method can be agreed on and 
implemented.
