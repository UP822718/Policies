Increase Science Research Budget To G8 Average
==============================================

The UK has a very strong technology development and scientific research 
sector. However, research funding is at a 20-year low of 0.5% of GDP. 
To ensure future sector health, we would increase funding to 0.8% of GDP 
(G8 average).
