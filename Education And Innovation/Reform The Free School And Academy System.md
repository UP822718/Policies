Reform The Free School And Academy System
=========================================

The introduction of academies and free schools has fragmented the 
education system, sometimes schools have been converted to academies 
against communities' wishes. Our ultimate aim is thorough reform of the 
school system once more bringing schools under local control, rather 
than centralised or commercial control. We would ensure that no school 
is forced to convert to an academy. No new free schools should be 
approved, and no further schools would be converted to academies.
