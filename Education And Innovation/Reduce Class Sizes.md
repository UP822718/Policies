Reduce Class Sizes
==================

Class sizes have a measurable impact on the performance of students of 
all ages. We would set a maximum class size, not as a guideline, but as 
a requirement for all schools within the UK with exceptions for schools 
where parents and governors actively want to see larger class sizes and 
are using some other methods to mitigate any negative impact.
