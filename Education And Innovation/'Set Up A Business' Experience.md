'Set Up A Business' Experience
==============================

We will trial a programme where 16-year-olds are encouraged to set up a 
small business as part of a work experience programme during or at the 
end of their final year of school. The programme would aim to actually 
establish viable businesses and provide the skills and experience 
required to run a small business.
