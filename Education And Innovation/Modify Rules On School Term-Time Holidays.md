Modify Rules On School Term-Time Holidays
=========================================

Parents may currently be prosecuted and fined for taking children on 
holiday during term time. Many parents may not be able to afford 
holidays outside term, or be able to take leave. While we support the 
goal of quality education for all, this creates an unnecessary burden on 
families. Parents would be permitted to take their children on holiday 
at any time.
