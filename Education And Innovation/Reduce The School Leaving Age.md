Reduce The School Leaving Age
=============================

We will investigate making education after the age of 14 voluntary. An 
initial trial where any 14-year-old who can pass a GCSE in Maths and 
English should be permitted to pursue a job or apprenticeship offer, 
with the option of returning to school if they lose their placement or 
would prefer to return to education.

This would allow young people who want to start working early or 
specialise as apprentices to remove themselves from classes, freeing up 
time and resources for those who would prefer to continue in education.
