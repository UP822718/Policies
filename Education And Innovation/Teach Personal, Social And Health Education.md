Teach Personal, Social And Health Education
===========================================

We would introduce teaching of Personal, Social and Health Education 
from Primary School.  Students would gain basic understanding of sexual 
relationships and sexual health.Learning PSHE topics early would help 
young people cope better with puberty transition and respect each other 
in future life.
