Open Access To Outputs of Publicly Funded Scientific Research
=============================================================

Everyone should have access to results of government-funded research. 
The Research Councils UK (RCUK) would continue commitment to full open 
access. We would support open access through RCUK providing grants to 
scholar-led open access journals and data archives. The RCUK would fund 
this by being exempt from article processing fees.
