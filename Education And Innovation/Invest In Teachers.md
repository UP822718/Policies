Invest In Teachers
==================

Schools should have the freedom to spend their budgets as they see fit 
and should be encouraged to invest in knowledgeable, enthusiastic and 
well qualified teachers. Over the last decade we have seen vast sums 
wasted on expensive school IT systems, often with maintenance, software 
licensing and other excessive or unnecessary costs attached. To make 
matters worse, schools are often locked into these costly systems for 
long periods, reducing schools' abilities to adapt to new technology and 
provide the best education to their students. An effort needs to be made 
to ensure that schools are aware of and can collaborate on the use of 
free and open source software, which could save significant amounts of 
money within education and redirect it back to teaching.
