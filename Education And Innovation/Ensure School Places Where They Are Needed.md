Ensure School Places Where They Are Needed
==========================================

Class sizes are vital for quality of education. Currently, there is a 
shortage of school places, particularly in primary schools, and local 
authorities are under pressure. We would reintroduce a robust legal 
requirement for councils to provide places and meet class size limits. 
Central government would ensure that necessary powers and funding are 
available to be able to meet need.
