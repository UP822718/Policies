Ending Faith Schools
====================

Schools may currently be designated as being of a religious character. 
This means they can not properly represent the whole communities where 
they are are, as well  These schools would no longer be able to select 
by religion when over-subscribed. Schools would no longer be able to be 
designated as having a religious character. Current schools with a 
religious character would have that status removed.
