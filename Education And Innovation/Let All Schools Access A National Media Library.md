Let All Schools Access A National Media Library
===============================================

The BBC, National Archives and other appropriate groups should be asked 
to establish a national media library for educational establishments. A 
large catalogue of material for students and teachers to make use of 
would diversify and increase the quality of media material available in 
education and would save money by centralising administration and 
technical costs.
