Add New Compulsory Citizenship Study To The Curriculum
======================================================

Our current system doesn't prepare young people for taking part in 
democracy and society well enough. A new compulsory citizenship study 
would cover the political system (from local to EU level). It would also 
cover economic fundamentals (inflation, interest, securities and
taxation) All GCSE students would be required to study it.
