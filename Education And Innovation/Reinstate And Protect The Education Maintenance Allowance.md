Reinstate And Protect The Education Maintenance Allowance
=========================================================

The Education Maintenance Allowance should be reinstated in England and 
protected in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland until a broader and 
tested alternative can be introduced to ensure that 16 to 18-year-olds 
in low-income families who are staying on at school can afford to study 
for A-levels. This would bring England back in line with in Scotland, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland. It is crucial lifeline of support for 
continuing education for many. When it was abolished, it cost Â£600m a 
year, a tiny amount in relation to the total of government spending.
