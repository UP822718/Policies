Have A National Curriculum That Says 'What' But Not 'How'
=========================================================

Schools should have the freedom to choose the teaching methods and 
materials they feel are most effective to ensure that their students are 
well equipped once they have completed their education. Decisions about 
what is taught and how should be as local as possible in all instances, 
and limitations on local decision making should be kept to a minimum.
