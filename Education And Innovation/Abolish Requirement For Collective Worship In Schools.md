Abolish Requirement For Collective Worship In Schools
=====================================================

As it stands, the law requires all schools to hold an act of collective 
worship every day. Even in schools that aren't 'faith' schools, this 
must be 'broadly Christian' in character. In a society which is 
increasingly diverse, this is an affront to the rights of young people 
to express their beliefs freely. Although there is the opportunity to 
opt out, this is reliant on parental permission and is not respected by 
all schools.

The law is extremely unpopular, with opinion polls showing teachers 
don't want it, parents don't want it, and children don't want it. As 
such, it is long past time for the daily act of collective worship to be 
replaced with inclusive assemblies that add to cohesion and a sense of 
community within schools. We should encourage schools to hold 
educational assemblies that will include all children, regardless of 
religion or non-religious belief.
