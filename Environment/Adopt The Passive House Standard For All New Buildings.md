Adopt The Passive House Standard For All New Buildings
======================================================

The Passive House standard requires a house to be be so well constructed 
and insulated that it is warm enough without requiring much heating; 
typically it will require no heating at all.

30,000 passive houses have been built around the world and the UK should 
work to catch up. We will aim to ensure that all new houses built in the 
UK adhere to a reasonable standard that is as close to the Passive House 
standard in terms of aims as possible.
