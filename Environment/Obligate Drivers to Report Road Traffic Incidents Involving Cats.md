Obligate Drivers to Report Road Traffic Incidents Involving Cats
================================================================

Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, accidents involving some animals must 
be reported. This currently includes dogs, goats, horses, cattle, etc., 
but not cats, which is an anomaly. By reclassifying cats, drivers who 
run over cats would have to report it to the police.
