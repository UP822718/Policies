Require Green Or Solar Roofing For All Newly-Built Commercial Buildings
=======================================================================

So much potential is wasted in commercial building use. We would require 
green or solar roofing for all newly-built commercial buildings. The 
soil and plants on green roofs lower urban temperatures and reduce 
flooding. This would apply to all new commercial buildings (e.g. 
supermarkets & factories). At least 50% of the roof would be required to 
be green roof or solar panels
