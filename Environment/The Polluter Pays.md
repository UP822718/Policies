The Polluter Pays
=================

We believe that if you damage the environment, it is your responsibility 
to pay for that damage to be reversed. The air around us, our waterways, 
and our landscapes are all common property. If they are damaged though 
an accident or through activity that pollutes, then that damage should 
be fixed. The government has a duty to ensure that those who cause such 
damage pay to do so. In the event that damage is global, as with climate 
change, it is doubly important to ensure that damaging activities are 
kept to a minimum and that funds are raised to deal with the 
consequences. It is also vitally important that we invest in research 
and technology to reduce the amount of damage that we do to our 
environment in the first place.
