Stop Public Subsides To Fossil Fuel Production
==============================================

We would stop public subsidies to fossil fuel / hydrocarbon production. 
No further Field Allowances would be offered.  

* The 30% Ring Fence Corporation Tax on oil and gas profits would be 
maintained

* The Supplementary Charge would return to 32% (it was recently reduced 
to 20%)

* The Petroleum Revenue Tax would stay at 50% (it would otherwise fall 
to 35% in 2016)
