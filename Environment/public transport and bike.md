public transport and cycles
============================

we will build new environmentally friendly public transport bus, trains and trams and will expand on the current offering of public transport.

we also look at ways of adding  safe cycle routes which are the cycle tracks or cycle path but not cycle lanes because they are unsafe down to the fact that drivers use the White line as a guide and Incredibly Close to that. additionally we will also add traffic lights and other traffic control measures to allow the normal flow of traffic and cyclists to be safe on the road together without causing accidents this can be done without mixing the car and cycles.

all of this together will make it more convenient for people to get around down to the fact that people that are unable to drive don't have to wait for a lift they might be able to get on the cycles or public transport. additionally it will cause less traffic on the road because cycles and public transport take up less space on the rode par person then cars.

when this document mentions cycles it is talking about but not limit to bike, E-bike, scooters, E-scooters, hoverboards, tricycle, E-tricycle, skateboards and electric skateboards. this list is not extensions to all examples.
