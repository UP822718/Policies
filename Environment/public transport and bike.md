Public Transport and Cycles
============================

We will build new environmentally friendly public transport bus, trains and trams and will expand on the current offering of public transport.

We also look at ways of adding safe cycle routes which are the cycle tracks or cycle path but not cycle lanes because they are unsafe down to the fact that drivers use the White line as a guide and Incredibly Close to that. Additionally, we will also add traffic lights and other traffic control measures to allow the normal flow of traffic and cyclists to be safe on the road together without causing accidents this can be done without mixing the car and cycles.

Having more public transport and cycles will make it more convenient for people to get around down to the fact that people that are unable to drive don't have to wait for a lift they might be able to get on the cycles or public transport. Additionally, it will cause less traffic on the road because cycles and public transport take up less space on the public highways per person than cars.

When this document mentions cycles, it is talking about but not limited to bike, E-bike, scooters, E-scooters, hoverboards, tricycle, E-tricycle, skateboards and electric skateboards. This list is not extensions to all examples.
