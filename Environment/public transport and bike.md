Public Transport and Cycles
============================
We will build new, environmentally friendly public transport (bus, trains and trams) and will expand on the current offering of public transportation.

We also look at ways of adding safe cycle routes which are the cycle tracks or cycle path but not cycle lanes because they are unsafe down to the fact that drivers use the White line as a guide and Incredibly drive Close to that. We will also add traffic lights and other traffic control measures. Improving public transport and cycles infrastructure will allow the normal flow of traffic and cyclists to be safe on the road together without causing accidents; this will happen without mixing the car and cycles.

Having more public transport and cycles will make it more convenient for people to get around. The people that unable to drive don't have to wait for a lift. They might be able to get on the cycles or public transport. Additionally, it will cause less traffic on the road because cycles and public transport take up less space on the public highways per person than cars.

Improving public transport and cycles infrastructure will, in turn, allow better participation by all members of society. The people who can drive will have less traffic on the road, allowing to quickly get to where they are trying to be with less chance on being in a traffic jam. The people who are unable to drive can use public transport or cycles this will, in turn, allow more members of society access services and infrastructure by enabling them better access to places like NHS, libraries, the jobcentre, work and school.
