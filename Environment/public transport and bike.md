Public Transport and Cycles
============================
We build new, environmentally friendly public transport (bus, trains and trams) and on the current offering of public transportation.

We also look at ways of adding safe cycle routes which are the cycle tracks or cycle path but not cycle lanes because they are unsafe down to the fact that drivers use the White line as a guide and Incredibly drive Close to that line â€” new traffic lights and other traffic control measures. Improving public transport, car infrastructure and cycles infrastructure normal flow of traffic and cyclists to be safe on the road together without causing accidents; this must plan out with little to no mixing the car and cycles on the same path.

More public transport and cycles make it more convenient for people to get around. The people that unable to drive don't have to wait for a lift. They might be able to get on the cycles or public transport. Additionally,  less traffic on the road because cycles and public transport take up less space on the public highways per person than cars.

Improving public transport and cycles infrastructure will, in turn, allow better participation by all members of society. The people who can drive are meting less traffic on the road, allowing to quickly get to where they are trying to be with less chance of being in Traffic congestion.
