Bottle Return Scheme
====================

A bottle return scheme is a charge added to the price on a bottled drink 
that you get back if you return said bottle to a certified outlet 
(essentially a deposit). We will trial the implementation of bottle 
return scheme schemes in the UK with a view to making them mandatory 
across the UK if they are found to be as effective in the UK as they 
have been in Germany and other countries. Bottle return schemes change 
the social landscape in other ways, too: bottles aren't left in the 
street, and if they are someone comes and picks them up, if only for the 
deposit. This ensures that there is less waste, more reuse and fewer 
glass hazards in public areas.
