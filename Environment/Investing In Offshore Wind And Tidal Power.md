Investing In Offshore Wind And Tidal Power
==========================================

Power generation will be a major issue facing the UK in the coming 
decade. The next government will have to put to get an effective and 
environmentally sound policy to deal with increasing generation 
capacity. We believe that the focus should be on renewable energy (such 
as offshore wind and tidal power generation) as well as investigating 
and developing new technologies, including nuclear, and continuing to 
improve the effectiveness of existing ones.

* The Renewables Obligation would be continued (a subsidy to large 
electricity generators) 

* The Feed-in Tariff would be continued (a subsidy for smaller 
generators)
