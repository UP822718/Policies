Egg Product Labelling
=====================

All products containing egg sold in the UK would have clear 
production-method labelling. This would apply to all products made with 
or including egg. It would include products made from egg-based 
ingredients produced abroad.  Farming conditions would be clearly 
indicated (e.g. "egg from free-range hens").
