Move Toward A Universal Basic Income

Instead of bailing out banks and channelling money through them to 
increase spending in the economy, help needs to get directly to those 
who are creating new ideas and new jobs.

However, it is not just a question of creating any old jobs; the focus 
of our economy should be jobs with a living wage. A vast number of 
people in the UK are paid less than what is required to live above 
poverty levels in their area. These people then need government support, 
essentially providing a subsidy for employers.

We would lift these people out of the poverty trap, firstly by ensuring 
that the minimum wage is a living wage wherever you live in the UK, and 
secondly by unifying and simplifying the benefits system with the 
eventual aim of implementing a Universal Basic Income for all British citizens.

A Universal Basic Income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable 
to each individual as a right of citizenship.

The idea would be to introduce this income, reduce the amount at which 
people are taxed and remove some existing tax credits.

Instituting an automatic, non-repayable, non-means-tested and 
unconditional Universal Basic Income is a long term aim for the Pirate Party. 
Such a payment would replace all benefits and tax credits. However 
there are significant hurdles to the implementation of such a system, 
including the need for comprehensive research into the social and 
economic impact it would have and whether it can be affordable. We 
think it is likely that such a programme is possible but would have to 
be reached incrementally. As such we propose funding trials to establish 
how such a system could be implemented.

Importantly, the incentive to work must remain, as getting a job would 
not remove the Universal Basic Income but would raise the amount of money 
coming in to the household. It would also create flexibility for single 
parent families, carers, disabled people and people wanting to dedicate 
their time to community or volunteering programmes, as part-time jobs 
would become a viable means of support.

As a result, the minimum wage could probably be lowered, the tax code 
could be simplified and the poorest in society would be safe from a 
lifetime of poverty.

The Universal Basic Income would need to be funded through tax increases and 
would represent significant wealth redistribution, but it would also 
increase efficiency in supporting everyone and massively reduce the 
cost of administrating and monitoring benefits payments.

While the minimum wage could probably be lowered due to the tax code 
being simplified and other factors, we would still aim to ensure that 
the minimum wage is sufficient incentive to work and to live on. At 
present the taxpayer subsidises employers by providing means tested 
benefits to working people on wages so low that they would not be able 
to survive if they did not have recourse to benefits.
