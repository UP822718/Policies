Make Pensions Fairer
====================

At present pensions providers are taking large amounts of the money that 
individuals save for their retirement in fees and commissions, often 
with a lack of clarity as to what such fees are for or whether they will 
be applied at all. Given the importance of saving for retirement, we 
would aim to disincentivise providers from charging excessive fees and 
ensure that any costs associated are clearly stated up front. All 
pension funds should have to state their costs in a clear, unobfuscated 
way at the point when a pension is set up. We will introduce a right to 
move pension savings to providers with lower overheads without penalty. 
We will work to reduce the cost of saving for retirement and try to 
ensure that everyone in the UK has access to quality pension products. 
All pension schemes must recognise same sex couples, and provide what 
pensioners need.
