Retain The Human Rights Act
===========================

Sadly recently human rights have been under attack. We would oppose any 
attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. We would ensure that the UK
would remain a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. This 
commitment is supported by Amnesty International.
