Rate All Spending In Pounds Per QALY
====================================

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence uses the "Quality 
Adjusted Life year" (QALY) as a measure of how much good a drug does. 
To be approved, the drug must buy at least one QALY for each Â£30,000 
spent.

We aim to trial the use of pounds per QALY in areas outside of health as 
an aid in decision making, with a view to rolling it out across all 
areas of government if it is successful. Using a uniform measure across 
defence, policing, education and all other areas of spending would give 
the public and government an idea as to where money can be best spent to 
achieve a rapid benefit. We believe that making explicit the estimates 
that go into justifying spending might give better results than hiding 
justifications or using less evidence based methods.
