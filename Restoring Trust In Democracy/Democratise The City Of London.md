Democratise The City Of London
==============================

We support the democratisation of the City of London. Given the City's 
huge impact on the UK it is important that it is accountable and 
transparent. We support an end to business and corporate block votes in 
all council elections; the abolition of existing "secrecy practices" 
within the City, and total and transparent reform of its institutions to 
end corporate tax evasion; the decommissioning of the City of London 
police with officers being brought under the jurisdiction of the 
Metropolitan police force; and the abolition of the offices of the Lord 
Mayor of London, the Sheriffs and the Aldermen.

Finally, we support a commission to examine any corruption, malpractice, 
or illegal activities within the City or its institutions with the aim 
of preventing any similar future abuses as well as ensuring that justice 
is done and seen to be done.
