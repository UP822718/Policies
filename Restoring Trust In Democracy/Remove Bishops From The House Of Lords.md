Remove Bishops From The House Of Lords
======================================

A significant proportion of the UK's population are non-religious, or 
are of another faith. Having Bishops in the House of Lords no longer 
provides useful representation. We are committed to House of Lords 
reform but this should be part of any changes, or  undertaken as an 
interim measure.
