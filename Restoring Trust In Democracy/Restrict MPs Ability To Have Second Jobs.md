Restrict MPs' Ability To Have Second Jobs
========================================

When MPs have other jobs it may be a distraction or cause a conflict of 
interest. MPs would only be permitted to work a maximum of 10 hours per 
week on other roles. This would make it feasible for people who own 
farms or small business's to become MPs, but remove the major conflicts 
we have seen over recent years.
