Require Sensible Service Contracts
==================================

Private for-profit transport providers have on occasion managed to 
renegotiate contracts with local and national authorities in order to 
reduce losses and costs when times have got tougher. These moves are 
almost always taken in order to protect profits and sometimes occur 
shortly after being awarded a franchise. This has led to poorer service 
to the communities that these providers serve and has harmed the 
reputation of local and national governments. We will ensure that 
private companies that bid to provide public services are held 
accountable for any breaches of contract.
