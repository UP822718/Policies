Reform The House Of Lords
=========================

Reform of the House of Lords is necessary to ensure that the Lords 
remains relevant and effective as an expert body, and acts as a proper 
check on the activities of the Commons. However the scope, scale and 
specifics of any reform are something that needs to be discussed at 
length and in public. We all have a stake in the future shape of of our 
democracy.

We intend to start a national discussion about the shape of the Lords 
and how it can be improved without damaging the work that the Lords 
does.
