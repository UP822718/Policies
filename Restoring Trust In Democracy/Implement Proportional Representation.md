Implement Proportional Representation
=====================================

We see proportional representation as vital to ensuring that government 
properly represents everyone, and that everyone's voice matters in 
elections. We intend to restart the national debate and push for a 
system of proportional representation to be implemented for all 
elections in the UK.
