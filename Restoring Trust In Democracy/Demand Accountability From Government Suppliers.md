Demand Accountability From Government Suppliers
===============================================

The delivery of services to government is littered with stories of 
companies exceeding budgets and delivering late. We will implement 
penalties for significant performance failures for government suppliers. 
If a company fails to deliver a government within 25% of budget or 25% 
of the deadline then that company (its parent organisations and 
subsidiaries) would be banned from providing services or products to the 
government for at least 2 years.
