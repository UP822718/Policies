Increase Government Transparency And Accountability
===================================================

We will introduce a new right for constituents to force a by-election in 
the event of a loss of confidence in their MP.

We will require minutes of all meetings of officials on government 
business to be accessible through Freedom of Information requests. We 
will also aim to ensure that all available information that could be 
requested under a Freedom of Information request is made public by 
default.

We will require that all international treaties be passed through the 
UK parliament as a standard bill, requiring the full approval of both 
houses.
