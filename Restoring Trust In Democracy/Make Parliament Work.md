Make Parliament Work
====================

To improve the quality of legislation we wish to see a much higher level 
of pre-legislative scrutiny for every bill before parliament.

We would investigate measures intended to reduce the power of the Whips 
in the Commons.

We would investigate the possibility of permanent elected legislative 
committees for each government department in the Commons rather than ad 
hoc public bill committees. There are a number of approaches that could 
work in this area and we would aim to trial a number of options to 
decide which is likely to be the most effective.

We would Implement the rest of the Wright report by creating a House 
business committee in the Commons and the recommendations of the 
Goodlad report in full for the Lords. As well as implementing a House 
business committee in the Lords and having an evidence-taking stage for 
all bills in addition to pre-legislative scrutiny.

We would limit the use rules to restrict debate in the Commons to cases 
of actual abuse of the rules of the House.

We would roll out post-legislative scrutiny on all important 
policy-changing bills before new bills on the same subject are be 
considered.

We would require the maintenance of a register of lobbyists as well as 
a record of all meetings between lobbyists and legislators or government 
officials.
